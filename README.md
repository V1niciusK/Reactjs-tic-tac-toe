# React Dev's Tic Tac Toe

This repo is based on React.dev's [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

I've changed a few things from the original tutorial:
1. Created a new component called Row (to test props and exercise arrow functions)
2. Changed the "squares" array to a bi-dimensional array (nested arrays inside the outer "board" array, representing the rows)
3. Adapted the original winning logic and button functionality to work with these added challenges
